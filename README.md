# Purchase Api

> This project was built using Ruby on Rails and Postgres.

## üí° Approach 

### Models
- Created the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) according to the initial - requirements, with two entities: "User" and "Order" to perform a purchase.
- For the "Orders" entity, predefined values are used for the payment status and order status.
- In the "Orders" entity, the payment date can be entered if the payment status is set to "paid".
- In the "Orders" entity, the delivery date can be entered if the order status is set to "delivered".

### Controllers
- User: Get a list of users, get a user by ID, add a new user, update the user's name, update the user's email, delete a user.
- Orders: Get a list of orders, get an order by ID, get all orders delivered on a specific date (day), add a new order, modify the payment status of an order, modify the dispatch status of an order, delete an order.
